<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not only is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="three burgers topped with cheese and bacon"></a><br>
<p>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="fish fillets topped with onions and tomato"></a><br>
<p>Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Crispy Deliciousness</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="golden crispy chicken wings"></a><br>
<p>The crunch you get biting into our famous wings is an experience you'll never be able to replicate in your life. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Wings of various flavors available, including carefully tossed in our famous "Oh God, am I dying?" sauce!</p>

<h2>Even More Crispy Deliciousness</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="fries with a side of ketchup"></a><br>
<p>The tastiest fries this side of the world, you'll never want to eat another fry again after you snack on these! We freeze and double fry these, ensuring a crispy outside and a soft inside. Now being served with pretentious artisenal ketchup, only an extra $5.</p>

<h2>Okay, This Doesn't Look Crispy Anymore</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="tabouleh salad molded into a cylinder"></a><br>
<p>For our vegan friends, we serve a snazzy tabouleh salad, prepared with tender love and care. I don't actually know what tabouleh tastes like so I can't tell you anything more, let's call it a surprise.</p>
